# Daily_learnings - Daily Technical Learnings

Welcome to **Daily_learnings**, a repository documenting my daily learnings on various technical subjects. This project serves as a personal knowledge bank and a way to track my growth and understanding in areas like **Next.js**, **Node.js**, and **Machine Learning**. 

Feel free to explore, learn, and even contribute ideas as I document my journey. ðŸš€

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the topics I'm learning. Each folder contains daily entries where I share what I learned, code snippets, resources, challenges, and solutions. Here's an overview of the structure:

- **`daily_node/`**  
  Focuses on learnings related to **Node.js**, including server-side programming, frameworks like Express, and backend development practices.

- **`daily_nextjs/`**  
  Covers **Next.js**, including server-side rendering, static site generation, API routes, and advanced React concepts.

- **`daily_datacamp/`**  
  Dedicated to **Machine Learning, Data Science and Deep Learning**, including algorithm overviews, Python implementations, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and practical examples.

## Goals of This Repository

1. **Documentation**: Keep a structured record of daily learnings.
2. **Sharing Knowledge**: Provide insights, tips, and resources that might help others.
3. **Accountability**: Stay consistent with daily technical growth.
4. **Portfolio**: Showcase skills and progress in these technical domains.

## How to Navigate

1. Browse through the folders based on the topics you're interested in:
   - **Node.js**: [`daily_node/`](./daily_node/)
   - **Next.js**: [`daily_nextjs/`](./daily_nextjs/)
   - **Machine Learning**: [`daily_datacamp/`](./daily_datacamp/)

2. Inside each folder, you'll find markdown files (`.md`) or text files documenting daily learnings. Files are named based on the date (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`) for easy navigation.

## Example Entry

Hereâ€™s a glimpse of what a typical daily learning entry might look like:

### `daily_node/2024-11-26.md`
```markdown
# Daily Learning - Node.js - November 26, 2024

## What I Learned
- Understanding middleware in Express.js.
- Creating custom middleware functions for logging and error handling.

## Key Takeaways
- Middleware functions have access to the request and response objects.
- Order matters! Middleware is executed sequentially.

## Challenges
- Debugging middleware chains when requests hang without errors.

## Resources
- [Express.js Documentation](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Middleware Patterns in Node.js](https://example.com)
